    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this fascinating experiment, you’ll learn how different liquids can stack on top of each other based on their density. Liquids with higher density will sink, while those with lower density will float. You will create a column of colorful liquids that demonstrate this principle in action!
    </p>

    <div class="intro">
      <h3>Why This Experiment Works</h3>
      <p>
        The concept of density is essential to understanding how substances behave in various conditions. Density is defined as the mass of an object per unit of volume. Substances with greater mass packed into a smaller volume have higher density. In this experiment, you will see how liquids with different densities can form layers when combined in a single container.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Materials Required</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 clear glass jar or container</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Honey or corn syrup</li>
      <li>Dish soap</li>
      <li>Rubbing alcohol (or isopropyl alcohol)</li>
      <li>Food coloring (various colors)</li>
      <li>Funnel (optional for pouring the liquids)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start by placing your clear glass jar on a stable surface.</li>
      <li>Pour honey or corn syrup into the bottom of the jar, filling it about 1/4 full. This will create your first layer, as honey has a high density.</li>
      <li>Next, slowly pour dish soap on top of the syrup. Use the back of a spoon or a funnel to pour slowly to prevent mixing. Dish soap has a lower density than honey but a higher density than water.</li>
      <li>Once the dish soap layer is stable, add water. You may want to add food coloring to make the layers more colorful. Water has a density lower than syrup and dish soap, so it will float above those liquids.</li>
      <li>Now, gently pour vegetable oil on top of the water. Vegetable oil has a lower density than water, so it will float above the water layer.</li>
      <li>Finally, pour rubbing alcohol (or isopropyl alcohol) on top of the vegetable oil. Alcohol has the lowest density of the liquids you’ve used, so it will form the top layer.</li>
      <li>Observe how the liquids form distinct layers in the jar! The denser liquids will stay at the bottom, while the less dense ones will float on top.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p>
      The liquids remain separated due to their different densities. The heaviest (most dense) liquid, such as honey, stays at the bottom of the jar, while the lightest liquid, such as rubbing alcohol, stays at the top. When you add liquids, ensure that each layer is carefully poured so as not to disturb the others, as this allows you to see the true effect of density in action.
    </p>

      <h3>Experiment Tips:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>To create a more colorful display, use different food coloring for each layer of water and alcohol.</li>
        <li>When pouring, do it slowly to prevent the layers from mixing. You can also use a funnel to pour the liquids gently.</li>
        <li>Try experimenting with other liquids that you think might float or sink. For example, you could use oil-based liquids like baby oil or a thicker syrup for even more distinct layers!</li>
        <li>Ensure that the container is transparent for the best visual effect.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Explanation of the Science Behind It</h2>
    <p>
      Density determines how well substances mix. The higher the density, the heavier the liquid, causing it to sink. In contrast, lighter liquids with lower density will float. By observing the layers, you can see how the relative densities of liquids determine their positions when placed together. The principle of density also helps explain how oil and water don’t mix – oil is less dense than water, causing it to float on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experiment also illustrates the importance of careful observation in science. By measuring the liquids and observing how they behave when combined, you can deduce the density of each liquid relative to the others.

    <h2>Further Exploration</h2>
    <p>
      If you’d like to explore this concept further, try creating density columns with more unusual liquids, such as glycerin or syrup with varying thickness. You could also compare the effect of temperature on the density of liquids – how does heating or cooling change the behavior of the liquids in the column?
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The density column experiment is a simple yet effective way to visualize the concept of density and observe how different substances interact based on their mass and volume. This experiment not only demonstrates how liquids of varying densities behave in a container, but it also opens up many opportunities for further exploration and understanding of the properties of matter.
