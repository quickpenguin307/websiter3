    <h2>What is Design Thinking?</h2>
    <p>
      Design thinking is a problem-solving process that focuses on understanding the needs of the user, brainstorming innovative solutions, and testing those solutions through prototyping. It’s a way to approach challenges with creativity, empathy, and practical application.
    </p>

    <h2>The Five Stages of Design Thinking</h2>
    <p>
      Design thinking is often broken down into five stages. These stages are not always linear, and you may go back and forth between them as you develop your solution:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Empathize:</strong> Understand the user's needs and challenges. Talk to real users to gather insights into their experiences and needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Define:</strong> Clearly define the problem you are trying to solve based on the insights you’ve gathered.</li>
      <li><strong>Ideate:</strong> Brainstorm a wide range of possible solutions. Encourage creativity and thinking outside the box.</li>
      <li><strong>Prototype:</strong> Build simple, low-cost versions of the potential solutions. Prototypes help you test your ideas quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Test:</strong> Test your prototypes with real users, get feedback, and refine your solution based on their input.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Thinking in Action</h2>
    <p>
      To illustrate how design thinking works in practice, here’s an example of a simple problem-solving exercise:
    </p>
    <h3>Problem: Designing a Better Backpack</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine you are asked to design a backpack for students who walk long distances to school. The current backpacks are heavy, uncomfortable, and not very organized.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step-by-Step Process:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Empathize:</strong> Talk to students and understand their pain points, such as back pain or difficulty organizing school supplies.</li>
      <li><strong>Define:</strong> Define the problem: "Students need a lightweight, comfortable, and well-organized backpack for long walks." </li>
      <li><strong>Ideate:</strong> Brainstorm ideas such as adjustable straps, ergonomic padding, separate compartments for books, and a built-in water bottle holder.</li>
      <li><strong>Prototype:</strong> Create a basic prototype of the backpack using materials like fabric, foam padding, and zippers.</li>
      <li><strong>Test:</strong> Let students try the prototype, gather their feedback, and refine the design based on their needs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why Design Thinking Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Design thinking emphasizes human-centered design, which means focusing on the real needs of users. This approach encourages innovation and allows you to create solutions that are both practical and meaningful. Whether you're solving a small problem or tackling a larger issue, design thinking can help you create impactful solutions.
